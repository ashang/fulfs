FULFS -- Fuse Using Large File System
-------------------------------------

The FULFS is a simple hack to store very large files in a filesystem with
filesize limitation. The primary purpose was putting DVD-size images on FAT32
and use it transparently to access big (splited) and small (not splited)
underlying files simultaneously. The files are stored in the form name.aa,
name.ab, ...

Usage:

./fulfs physical-storage-dir virtual-dir [ chunk size ]

where the chunk size can be completed with a k/K/m/M/g/G suffix, meaning a
decimal or binary (upper case) factor of the particular unit.

Limitations:

 - Uses only two letter suffix, resulting in 26^2 files. Which means a maximum
   file size of about 1.3TB on a 2GB-limited filesystem.
 - owner and permission change is not allowed since atomic operations are not
   implemented yet.

Installation:

Install pkgconfig, install fuse library (version >> 2.5.0, from
http://fuse.sourceforge.net or a modern Linux distribution, including the
development files (eg. libfuse-dev on Debian).

Run "make". Get the resulting binary from the build subdirectory.

LICENSE:

source package.

THANKS:

Many thanks to Miklos Szeredi for the FUSE package which allowed a quick and
almost painless implementation.

HISTORY:

 - clean rewrite of my previous solution, the vlfs plugin for LUFS
